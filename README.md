# Preact Starter

Simple project to get started using [Preact](https://preactjs.com).

## Notes

This template is set up to deploy to GitHub Pages. Because GHPages sites are often under a directory (e.g. https://andrewiggins.github.io/preact-starter/ (the `preact-starter` path in this example)), this project by default starts the web server under the workspace root. Doing this better simulates the GHPages server since your project's local URL will also be under a directory (https://localhost:5000/dist). It is recommended to rename `dist` to your GitHub repo's name so that it matches the path GHPages will deploy to (e.g. https://localhost:5000/preact-starter).
