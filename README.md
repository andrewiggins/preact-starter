## Notes

This template is set up to deploy to GitHub Pages. In order for the build output
to work on GitHub Pages, replace `/preact-starter` in the package.json `build`
script with the `/` + the name of your repo. This change ensures that your
scripts are served from the correct path when deployed to GitHub Pages.
