# Preact Starter

Simple project to get started using [Preact](https://preactjs.com) &
[vite](https://vitejs.dev).

## Notes

This template is set up to deploy to GitHub Pages. In order for the build output
to work on GitHub Pages, replace `/preact-starter` in `vite.config.json` with
the `/` + the name of your repo. This change ensures that your scripts are
served from the correct path when deployed to GitHub Pages.
